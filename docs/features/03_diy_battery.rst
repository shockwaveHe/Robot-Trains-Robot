DIY Battery (WIP)
==================
If you want more run time, you can build your own battery with 21700 cells. It can store more energy with the same size as the LiPo battery off the shelf.

To start, purchases these components in the bom:
- 4x 21700 cells
- 4x single cell 21700 battery holder
- 1x JST-PH connectors kit
- 1x presoldered XT30 connector

Print the battery plate, and install the 4 holders with M3 flat head screws.

And then follow the wiring in the diagram below:


Note that the positive and negative terminals looks like this, make sure you get the polarity right when installing the battery. The 21700 cells have terminals close to each other, so be gentle not to puncture the insulation layer and accidentally short the terminals.

Once this is done, test the voltage of the xt30 connector and make sure the voltage is correct (xt30 voltage = sum of each individual cell voltage).

Now your battery is ready to be charged, use the same lipo charger and procedure and charge the battery before use.

At this point, you can proceed to use the battery the same way as before!
