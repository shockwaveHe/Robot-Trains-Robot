Safety Stand
------------------------
We designed a safety stand that securely holds ToddlerBot, allowing you to place it on a table or the ground 
and test it without requiring it to stand on its own. The instructions are detailed in the :ref:`safety_stand` section.

Teleoperation Arms
-------------------------------

Inspired by `ALOHA <https://aloha-2.github.io/>`_, we built a teleoperation system for ToddlerBot by assembling a second upper body as the leader arms. 
This allows intuitive controlâ€”simply hold its hands and guide it like a toddler.
The instructions are in the :ref:`teleoperation_arms` section.

DIY Battery Pack
---------------------------------------------------
Switching from an off-the-shelf LiPo battery to four 21700 cells can double battery life. However, 
this is recommended only for advanced users experienced with soldering and handling electronics. 

.. warning::
   A 21700 battery holds a significant amount of energy and can be hazardous if mishandled. 
   Handle with care, and avoid puncturing the insulation layer.
